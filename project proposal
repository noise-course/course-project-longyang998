Project title
○
Classifying VPN and Non-VPN Traffic Using Machine Learning
Project summary:
○
Problem : It is difficult to identify what kind of activity is happening when
people use VPN because their network traffic is encrypted.
○
Important: Being able to distinguish VPN from non-VPN traffic helps improve
network management and security monitoring.
○
Relation to Course Theme: This project lies at the intersection of networking
and machine learning, applying ML models to analyze and classify encrypted
traffic patterns.
○
Related Work: Prior research (e.g., NetML and nPrint benchmarks) explores
flow-based feature extraction for encrypted traffic identification, which we plan to
build upon.
○
Goal: Our primary goal is research and reproducibility — to replicate and extend
previous results by testing additional algorithms and comparing performance
metrics.
Data: What data will you be using for the project?
○
Dataset found on the site
https://nprint.github.io/benchmarks/application_identification/netml_vpn-nonvpn.

Machine learning: What models do you expect to try?
○
Random forest, Naive Bayes, Lasso regression
Evaluation: How will you evaluate your models?
○
We will split the dataset into training and test set(80/20).
○
Analyze feature importance to understand which traffic characteristics best
distinguish VPN and non-VPN flows.
Deliverable: Clean Jupyter Notebook: fully executable from start to finish includes all
data processing, model training, evaluation and visualization inline.
Learning objective: What are you expecting to learn from your project?
○
We aim to understand which network features(packet size, timing, protocol
patterns) are most effective for identifying VPN usage.
